# Access Network 
There are 3 different areas:
- edge
	- 
- backbone
	- is the core network, with mesh topology. consists of multiple switches
- Nodes 
	- Access Point, modem

## Wired
physical cables to connect to the network. (DSL, fiber-optic, ethernet)
Copper based (copper is material)
Fiber based (fiber cable)
The material as an important impact

1. Fiber-optic access (thin glass or plastic fibers to transmit data)
2. DSL (telephone lines to transmit data)
3. Cable Access (coaxial cable)

> The faster cable today is fiber-optic cables.

Optical access, this domain will be he mode of choice for fixed access in the coming years. represent systems capable of delivering ultra high speed, high reliability performance. 

- GE-PON
- GPON
- COF

> For example, video streaming require a fiber connection.

There are many different types of fiber connection:
- ftth (!)
- fttc (!)
- fttn
- fttp
- fttb (!)
- fttu
- fttz
- ftto
- fttd

### PON (passive optical network)
Passive branching of fibes via optical splitters and tree-based topologies.
It is created by combine two optical cable. The signal enter and exit in two parts.



## Wireless
Wireless access uses radio signals to connect to the network.
Use case: WiFi, Bluetooth, Cellular.
