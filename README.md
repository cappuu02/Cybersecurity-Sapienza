Welcome, this is a repository where you can find notes related to the 2024/2025 cybersecurity master's course at Sapienza University of Rome Cpitale (Come on Rome come on) The files are written in Markdown language on the Obsidian software. For a correct visualization I recommend you clone the entire repository and create once on obsidian, also to be able to correctly view the images and notes in an orderly manner.
For a better vision I recommend installing, in Obsidian, the `Admonition` plugin that allows the visualization of colored sections used in the notes to define Theorems, Lemmas and reasoning recap.
