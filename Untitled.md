### Step-by-Step Explanation:

Let's break down the explanation step by step to understand what each part means. We'll start with the important concepts and slowly connect everything together.

### **1. "Non-trivial": If fff is OWF, then so is f′(x)=0∣∣f(x)f'(x) = 0 \mid \mid f(x)f′(x)=0∣∣f(x).**

**OWF** stands for **One-Way Function**. A one-way function is easy to compute in one direction, but hard to invert without a secret or additional information. This means that if you can compute f(x)f(x)f(x) easily for a given xxx, it is computationally difficult (intractable) to compute xxx from f(x)f(x)f(x).

- **f(x)f(x)f(x) is OWF**: This means it is easy to compute f(x)f(x)f(x), but hard to compute xxx from f(x)f(x)f(x).
- **f′(x)=0∣∣f(x)f'(x) = 0 \mid \mid f(x)f′(x)=0∣∣f(x)**: This means you are constructing a new function f′(x)f'(x)f′(x) by prepending a 0 to the output of f(x)f(x)f(x). The notation ∣∣\mid \mid∣∣ is a concatenation operator, so the new output of f′(x)f'(x)f′(x) is a 0 concatenated with f(x)f(x)f(x).

The claim here is that if f(x)f(x)f(x) is a one-way function (OWF), then f′(x)=0∣∣f(x)f'(x) = 0 \mid \mid f(x)f′(x)=0∣∣f(x) is also a one-way function. This is because adding a trivial bit (0) to the output of f(x)f(x)f(x) does not affect the difficulty of inverting the function. In other words, knowing f′(x)=0∣∣f(x)f'(x) = 0 \mid \mid f(x)f′(x)=0∣∣f(x) still makes it hard to recover xxx, because f(x)f(x)f(x) itself is hard to invert.

#### Key Idea:

- f′(x)=0∣∣f(x)f'(x) = 0 \mid \mid f(x)f′(x)=0∣∣f(x) does not change the fact that f′(x)f'(x)f′(x) is still a one-way function because it still "hides" xxx in a way that makes it computationally difficult to reverse.

### **2. "Non-trivial": f′(x)f'(x)f′(x) is not a PRG!**

Here, f′(x)f'(x)f′(x) is **not a PRG** (Pseudorandom Generator). While f′(x)f'(x)f′(x) is a one-way function, it doesn't necessarily have the properties of a pseudorandom generator.

- **PRG**: A pseudorandom generator is a function that generates output that "appears" random, but is deterministically generated from a seed. The important property of a PRG is that its output is indistinguishable from random values (to anyone who does not know the seed).

While f′(x)f'(x)f′(x) is a one-way function, it does not necessarily satisfy the criteria of a pseudorandom generator. This means that f′(x)f'(x)f′(x) does not produce output that looks random enough to be used as a cryptographic random source.

### **3. "If fff is OWF, then so is f′(x)=x[1]∣∣f(x)f'(x) = x[1] \mid \mid f(x)f′(x)=x[1]∣∣f(x), where x[1]x[1]x[1] is the first bit of xxx."**

Now, consider the new construction of f′(x)=x[1]∣∣f(x)f'(x) = x[1] \mid \mid f(x)f′(x)=x[1]∣∣f(x), where x[1]x[1]x[1] is the **first bit** of xxx. This means we take the first bit of the input xxx, concatenate it with the output of f(x)f(x)f(x), and define this as our new function f′(x)f'(x)f′(x).

- **Why is this still a One-Way Function (OWF)?**

If f(x)f(x)f(x) is an OWF, meaning it’s hard to invert f(x)f(x)f(x), adding the first bit of xxx (i.e., x[1]x[1]x[1]) to f(x)f(x)f(x) does not make it any easier to invert. The fact that you know x[1]x[1]x[1] doesn't help you recover the rest of xxx or invert f(x)f(x)f(x), so the new function f′(x)=x[1]∣∣f(x)f'(x) = x[1] \mid \mid f(x)f′(x)=x[1]∣∣f(x) remains a one-way function.

This shows that even after appending some additional information (in this case, the first bit of xxx), the function retains its one-way property. This is important because we’re demonstrating that it’s still hard to recover xxx from f′(x)f'(x)f′(x), making it a one-way function.

### **4. Hard-core bit:**

A **hard-core bit** is a specific bit of information about xxx that is difficult to compute, even when you have access to f(x)f(x)f(x).

- The function h(x)h(x)h(x) is a hard-core bit if, given f(x)f(x)f(x), it’s hard to compute h(x)h(x)h(x). This means that even though we can compute f(x)f(x)f(x), it should be computationally difficult (or impossible) to derive a specific bit h(x)h(x)h(x) from f(x)f(x)f(x).

#### Key Concept:

- Every function fff that is a one-way function (OWF) has a **hard-core bit**, which is a bit that is difficult to compute from f(x)f(x)f(x).

### **5. PRG Construction Using f(x)f(x)f(x):**

The construction of the **pseudorandom generator** G(s)G(s)G(s) is given by:

G(s)≡f(s)∣∣f(s)G(s) \equiv f(s) \mid \mid f(s)G(s)≡f(s)∣∣f(s)

This means that G(s)G(s)G(s) is created by concatenating two copies of f(s)f(s)f(s). If f(s)f(s)f(s) is a one-way function, then G(s)G(s)G(s) is a pseudorandom generator.

#### Why does this work as a PRG?

- The idea behind this construction is that the output of f(s)f(s)f(s) should be computationally indistinguishable from random values (since f(s)f(s)f(s) is one-way). By concatenating two outputs of f(s)f(s)f(s), we are essentially increasing the size of the output and making it harder to distinguish from a truly random sequence.
- This construction works as a **pseudorandom generator** because the output appears random to any observer who doesn’t know sss, and it's hard to distinguish it from a random sequence generated from a truly random source.

### **Summary of Key Points:**

- If f(x)f(x)f(x) is a one-way function (OWF), then f′(x)=0∣∣f(x)f'(x) = 0 \mid \mid f(x)f′(x)=0∣∣f(x) remains a one-way function, but it’s not a PRG.
- A function f(x)f(x)f(x) always admits a hard-core bit, which is a bit that’s difficult to compute even when you know f(x)f(x)f(x).
- From a one-way function f(x)f(x)f(x), you can construct a pseudorandom generator G(s)=f(s)∣∣f(s)G(s) = f(s) \mid \mid f(s)G(s)=f(s)∣∣f(s), which is secure under the assumption that fff is a one-way function.

This approach connects one-way functions, hard-core bits, and pseudorandom generators in cryptography.
