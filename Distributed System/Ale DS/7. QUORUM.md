## Quorum Definition and Properties

We have $n$ processes in our set of total processes $P$, **a quorum is any subset of $P$ of size at least**: $$\frac{n}{2}+1 = \text{Majority}$$![[Pasted image 20241030175001.png|500]]
**property**: any two quorums intersect in at least one process (suppose two quorums do not intersect, then they have all distinct processes. This implies $|P|>n$)

If we have:
- $C$: set of correct processes.
- $F$: set of faulty processes.

We don't know who is in $C$ and who is in $F$ but if we assume $f<\frac{n}>{2}$ (Majority of the processes are in $C$), then we can say that:

**Any quorum $Q$ of $P$ contain at least one correct process** ($C$ is a quorum, $Q$ is a quorum tooo. Two quorums intesect in at least one process).


**Example**: takes 4 processes at random, at least one of them will be green. Protip: it works even if you first take your set and then you decide which is green and which is red.![[Pasted image 20241021141413.png|500]]
## Implementation in Fail-Silent

Implements **URB** and uses **BEB**.
**We need to assume a majority of correct processes**.


**Majoriti-ACK**:
![[Pasted image 20241021142438.png|500]]
if I reach the treshold is fine but can happen that the number of ACK will never be reached
(if |F| > n/2 and I wait for |F|+1 I will wait forever once everyone in F crashed. This means that the validity will never be satisfied)

We can use perfetct failure detector:

## Ordered Communications

- Define guarantees about the order of deliveries inside group of processes
- Type of ordering:
	- Deliveries respect the FIFO ordering of the corresponding send
	- Deliveries respect the Causal ordering of the corresponding send
	- Delivery respects a total ordering of deliveries (atomic communication, we will see them after consensus)

## FIFO BROADCAST
can be regular or uniform

**properties**
first 4 properties = RB
**FRB5** (FIFO Delivery): if some process broadcast message $m_1$ before it broadcasts message $m_2$, then no correct process delivers $m_2$ unless it has already delivered $m_1$.

**FIFO RELIABLE BROADCAST**:
FIFO property is orthogonal with reliability guarantees (you can be FIFO but not regular nor uniform):

## CAUSAL ORDER BROADCAST

**Guarantees that messages are delivered such that they respect all cause–effect relations**.
Causal order is an **extension of the happened-before relation**.
A message $m_1$ may have potentially caused another message $m_2$ (denoted as $m_1$ → $m_2$) if any of the following holds:
- some process $p$ broadcasts $m_1$ before it broadcasts $m_2$.
- some process $p$ delivers $m_1$ and subsequently broadcasts $m_2$.
- there exists some message $m′$ such that $m_1$ → $m′$ and $m′$ → $m_2$

### NO-WAIT Casual Reliable Broadcast (NO-Wait CRB)

**Properties**:
- **CRB1-CRB4** = RB1-RB4
- **CRB5** (Causal Delivery): : For any message $m_1$ that potentially caused a message $m_2$, i.e., $m_1$ → $m_2$, no process delivers $m_2$ unless it has already delivered $m$.
