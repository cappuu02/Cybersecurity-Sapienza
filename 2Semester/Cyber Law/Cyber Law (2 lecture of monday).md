Science doesn't think. (just an observation that highlight the perimeter of interest of science). 
**Experiment** must always be repeatable and demonstrable

**Corrente filosofica**: guardare fenomeni con approcci e viste differenti (==phenomenology==).what phenomenal with differents angles and prespective (no facts, but only interpretation of facts). gli scienziati devono capire le cose prima dei fatti effettivi.

Right part for the men is not going straight away to the goal. The project is made up of components of exploration that has a lot of wondering and experiencing, a lot of point of view. 

Our intelligence is dynamic. The information that is narrative simulate events.

To what element do we own this big change?  to Some historical issue 
**Earthly order**
**WELT** = World in tedesco (our world is a **umwelt** (world ready to be lead by humans))

What is abitare? **Abitare** is an interesting world, means "live", be familiar, means routine.

After break

This age of technology is characterized of the complete idea of dominion.
A the same time we experience single idea of disorientation. 
Increasing knowledge that make us more competent and provided for ourself.
This knowledge does not produce higher understanding. The more we know, the more we are competent, more we understand. 

Other people tell us questions to know our experience, Knowledge, .....
`INTER-ESSE` = To be in the same ship (All share the same human experience)
The inter-esse here is an economic interest.

The material things disappear and direclty substituted by technological things.
Translate all in digital form. Problem? Project of re-writing the world in digital way and things lose his value. We are more interesting. With most of tech items we do not have the complete access to them like, for example, digital subscription, car tap and go, digital games, airb&b, and so on...

`Reality` 
We must be careful and avoid of presence of the objects we are surrounded. (big quantity). Before the industrial revolution, market and fields, objects stabilize a continuity. Dispate changing nature, some object attach to the real world.
With these object we are an `attaccamento sentimentale`. 
Today connection with things, and even more with people, are discarded (in a consumistic declination). More money > more consumismi > more and more....

Bruno Romano $\to$ distinguish freedom in two declination
- **being free with** (achieve his freedom including the other humans being in our  horizon)
- **being free by** (freedom where other is )

`Object = ject (giacere)`

This evolution lose their three dimensionality ad they become flat. This solution of things become flatness and are describe as manifestation of a specific form of `nihilism` (a philosophy that rejects the idea of inherent meaning, purpose, or value in life). Come from `nihi`, that means nothing. `No-thing` or in italian `Ni-ente`.
`Sein Und Zeit (essere a/in tempo)` 1927, almost 100 years ago.

We have replaced manual labor with new services that other people do for us. We have translated everything into digital terms, with the ability to order everything with simple clicks.

`Zu-Handen/heit` (`handen` = mani) ----- `Zu-digit/heit` 
`Vor Handen/heit` (`handen` = mani) ---- `Vor digit/heit`
`Gestell` where be place all the objects that we need, and when we need we grab them.
Now, we don't have more this resources, are replaced with technology.

We have another problem with AI. Services are integrated with AI. Artificial Intelligence substitute the customer/producer or a person.  

>We need only connection to do these things, behind a screen.

`Alter` is able to alterate us. (alterate comes from chemical view, alteration of the state. Humans are like that, if we talk and have interactions with differents peoples we can alterate us or not.) In internet we are connected with our opinion, and not in physical presence.

>The more you repress the more cyberbully arrive.

## Third Lecture

We must avoid being forced by the extra presence of objects that surround us. 
Before the market revolution, there was a lot 

Heartly order, order that belongs to world. Why did we hat int this way?

we can define the human beigs as a beings that is able to be. Can take differents paths, wonder can go back, can go fordward. the path that we created as we walk it to our work and commitment. 

Introduce another concept from Hideger!
The way describe these constants of our existence of pursuing our gol project. This costant condition of being in a project, connected in a project and this is called `sorge = care, cura`. Indicates at the same time the attitude of attention, dediction on something. 
Why he said that `sorge` is the important way in that the human being exists? 
In the search of meaning of our existence, since  we are not guided only by instincs and since we are not defined by programs, our life that has freedome, difficulty from other human beings is also exposed  to the risk of manigrasses and fsilures.

`sorge`
- `have-care` $\to$ `ruchsicht` (means to )
- `take-care` $\to$ `nachsicht` (to see own wordl)

two different way to have carefull of each other
In both case taking care and having care for someone means working. and work contains the effort , the commitment to realization. `labor` (parola che indica il dolore del parto e anche il fattore di produzione).
 Human being in this project is gradually able to transfer his mental skills to things, SO that things woks for him (washing machine). In this way the subjective spirit is corrupted and his transferred in the spirit of object. Since the instrument is lazy because we need to program it. we need to install in the system the autonomy. The human beings can be free from works. The next step of civilization involves in planting not only strenght and energy but lso intelligence (attribute some spiritual). The homo digitalis not only things wors for him but also is also trying to make that thing. DIgitalization offers to our life that is comparable to a gain.  The leak of grips on the heartly order represented by things is replaced by .....
 Human being in this online dimension no longer have objects to manipulate loses, progressive, limiting to the views of fingers. If the hand as we saw in the past lesson is the organ of wors through we develop the intelligence as we are connected to technology, the fingers are the organs of the choice. (click button to satisfy things). Being in the net bring us in a condition of nichilismo, therefore objects cannot be possessed anymore. More than possession the contemporary era of access. `posses -> access`.
In this dimension object and people are replaced by network. The possession is based on stable vision of reality. SO we are constantly invited to move on and not to identify our self. In these platforms, our identity become products. we produce our self the social media.
`???? -> perform out identity`. Our identity become products and our life is replaced by simple things and likes. like represent a preference. This preference, they have no qualitative content, they are measured on the base of quantity. So we can observe that the digital evolution, does not represent a change but is the imposition of new form of culture.
`culture` 
- cult = worship (taking different form of society)

There are three types of society:
- `Archetypical` 
	- arche = origin, beginning (something that directs the rest of how we struct the society (based on a god for example))  arche impose the rule to all the others! over the time, god lost the power to influence the history. Nietzsche said that the god is dead, meaning that 
	- `prototypical` = `protos` means first. 
- `Stereotypical`= based on data and information (data are standard types, correclty read by machines.)

The more culture become a commodity the more the original idea of community is destroyed. The online community is modified version of real community. These online community are made of digitals of swarms. Instead of the community the individual user and his profile are placed at the center of this digital culture. This type change the view of the world. The world that we experiment online become theored on us and follows our preferences. The idea is that through the digital medium are no longer through in this world. Apparently, the world give me the impression of being total at my disposal.
`zufingerheit`
I have progressively eliminate the negativity of others. IN this way i reduce or i believe to reduce the coefficient of ??  my existence. The other generate alteration on us.
`other `
`alter -> alteration` (responding to a stimulus that come from outside but is something to do with what i have inside e come reagisco ad esso) If something alters us is because there is somethings in that this alter us. Our identity is something that we build with others and sometimes against the others.
